Problem:
Find the derivative of the function:
\[
    f(X) = x^3
\]

---

Solution:
For this problem, you'll need to use the "power rule," which basically says to bring the exponent down and turn it into a coefficient in front of the variable, and then subtract one from the exponent. In math speak, 

{d}{dx}{x^n} = nx^{n-1}

In this problem, the exponent 3 comes down in front of the variable x, and then you subtract 1 from the exponent 3 to get an exponent of 2 in the final answer:

\[
    f'(x) = 3x^{2}
\]

Why does this matter?
The power rule is a crucial tool when finding derivatives of functions. It's fast and easy to use which makes it a very good concept for the first Daily Derivative post.

Stay tuned for the next post coming soon... maybe it'll be a physics problem, or it might be an announcement about a cool new movie I watched. Only time will tell...
